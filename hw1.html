    <h2>My New Passion</h2>
    <div>I got into computer science by a Chinese TV drama that was about a 
    team that competed in CTF's. From there I tried to do the same thing on my own 
    which didnt take me far with the little experience I had. It still fascinated me 
    and as an almost junior in high school still looking for something to do with her life, 
    I looked into the field more. The demand for black girls in cybersecurity did not get overlooked,
    alothough if I was being honest with myself, I didnt want to do cybresecurity as a forever job. 
    I liked web development the most. I found this out by doing a bunch of unoffical side projects after I realized the amount 
    of knowledge I needed to do CTF's; its not just a pick up the computer and play kind of game. The side projects 
    I did were in html and css. I never understood the javascript syntax and never tried for another language
    because of the joy I got from just doing the markup languages. I would follow w3schools, freecodingcamp.com, 
    watch youtube videos, and just explore the different aspects of html and css. I had apps downloaded on my phone that had 
    math based questions of mostly javascript, python, and html that I would do instead of scroll through my phone. I really 
    enjoy coding and can't wait to learn more languages. The more I explored what I could do in computer science the mroe interested 
    I got! I learned about mobile development, Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, software engineering, and more! So to keep 
    my options open, I picked Computer Science instead of a more concentrated degree like software engineering. Admittedly, this is my favorite 
    class so far because I can get officially educated on how to do web development, my favorite aspect of Computer Science.
